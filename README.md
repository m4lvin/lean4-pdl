# Propositional Dynamic Logic in Lean 4

[![CI status](https://github.com/m4lvin/lean4-pdl/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/m4lvin/lean4-pdl/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Project Goal

The aim is to prove that Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) has the Craig Interpolation property.
The main reference is the following.

- Manfred Borzechowski, Malvin Gattinger, Helle Hvid Hansen, Revantha Ramanayake, Valentina Trucco Dalmas, Yde Venema:
  *Propositional Dynamic Logic has Craig Interpolation: a tableau-based proof.*
  Preprint 2025, <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13276>

The article contains direct links to the corresponding parts of the formalization here.
A checkmark in the article means that the Lean statement is `sorry`-free, including all its dependencies.
There is no separate blueprint.
