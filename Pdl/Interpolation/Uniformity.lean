/-! # Uniformity of split tableaux (Section 8.1)

This file defines when a tableau is *uniform*, by the two conditions U1 and U2 of the
paper, and shows that in a uniform tableau every loaded cluster has the property
`LoadedCluster.HasUniformSteps` that the construction of the quasi-tableau needs.

Recall the two conditions from the paper, where `Λ₁(s)` and `Λ₂(s)` are the left and the
right component of the sequent at the node `s`, and where `i ∈ {1,2}`:

* **U1.** If `Λᵢ(s)` is loaded then a local rule is applied to a formula in the unloaded
  component of `s`, unless that component is basic.
* **U2.** If `Λᵢ(s) = Λᵢ(t)` is loaded and not basic, and the unloaded components of both
  `s` and `t` are basic, then at `s` and at `t` the same rule is applied, to the same
  formula in the loaded component of the node.

Both conditions speak about the nodes of the tableau in the sense of the paper, i.e. also
about the nodes *inside* the local tableaux. Hence we state them for `FinePathIn tab`.
Note that in U2 the loaded component is not basic, so the rule applied at `s` and at `t`
must be a *local* rule; we therefore phrase U2 using `FinePathIn.lra?`, and "the same rule
applied to the same formula" becomes `LocalRuleApp.SameRuleAs`: the two rule applications
have the same principal formulas (`Lcond`, `Rcond` and `Ocond`) and the same results
(`ress`), and indeed use the same rule (`lr`).

The main result is `LoadedCluster.uniformOfUniTab`. Its proof splits into two cases, and
only the second one uses uniformity:

* If `Δ` is basic then by Lemma 9.7 (e) — here `Uniformity.basicModalStep` — the rule
  applied at a node of `C^R_Δ` is the modal rule `(M)` for the loaded formula of `Δ`, and
  hence the right component of the unique child only depends on `Δ`.
* If `Δ` is not basic then the rule applied at a node of `C^R_Δ` is a local rule acting on
  the right. By U1 the left component of such a node is basic, so U2 applies and says that
  the same rule with the same principal formula is used at all these nodes. Since a local
  rule application only changes the right component by deleting its principal formulas and
  adding the results, the right components of the children agree — this is
  `Uniformity.map_rightOnly_C_eq`.

## Duplicated helper lemmas

The file `Pdl.ClusterInterpolation` imports this file (it uses `Tableau.isUniform` and
`LoadedCluster.uniformOfUniTab`), so we cannot use the lemmas about right rules that are
proved there. The section `Uniformity` below therefore repeats those that are needed here,
under different names.

/-! ## The components of a sequent -/

/-- The left component of a sequent, together with the loaded formula, again as a sequent.
This is `Λ₁` from the paper; compare `Sequent.rightOnly`, which is `Λ₂`. -/
def Sequent.leftOnly (X : Sequent) : Sequent := ⟨X.1, ∅, X.2.2⟩

/-- The left component of a sequent, without any loaded formula. When the loaded formula
is on the right, i.e. in the situation of a `LoadedCluster`, this is the *unloaded*
component `Λ₁` of the node, and `Sequent.leftFree X |>.basic` says that no local rule is
applicable to it. -/
def Sequent.leftFree (X : Sequent) : Sequent := ⟨X.1, ∅, none⟩

/-- The right component of a sequent, without any loaded formula. When the loaded formula
is on the left this is the *unloaded* component `Λ₂` of the node. -/
def Sequent.rightFree (X : Sequent) : Sequent := ⟨∅, X.2.1, none⟩

/-- Two local rule applications use the same rule with the same principal formulas.
The fields `Lcond`, `Rcond` and `Ocond` are the principal formulas and `ress` is the list
of results of the rule, so this says that the *same rule instance* is applied at two nodes,
which may still have different sequents. -/
def LocalRuleApp.SameRuleAs (lra₁ lra₂ : LocalRuleApp) : Prop :=
  lra₁.Lcond = lra₂.Lcond ∧ lra₁.Rcond = lra₂.Rcond ∧ lra₁.Ocond = lra₂.Ocond
    ∧ lra₁.ress = lra₂.ress ∧ HEq lra₁.lr lra₂.lr

/-! ## Uniformity -/

/-- Condition U1: at a node with a loaded component, a rule is applied to the *unloaded*
component unless the latter is basic. Since every rule is a left rule or a right rule but
not both (`FinePathIn.not_left_and_right`), we state this as: a rule on the unloaded side
is applied.

The condition is only about nodes at which a rule is applied at all, i.e. we exclude the
leaves given by a loaded-path repeat, which is what `¬ f.base.isLrep` says. Note that this
exclusion is needed: at a loaded-path repeat the tableau stops, so no rule at all — and in
particular no rule on the unloaded component — is applied there, while the sequent of a
loaded-path repeat may well have a non-basic unloaded component. (For example, the sequent
reached again after a loop may contain a conjunction on the unloaded side; the tableau is
then forced to stop, because `Tableau.loc` and `Tableau.pdl` both require `¬ flprep`.)
Without the exclusion no tableau with such a repeat would be uniform, and `Tableau.toUniform`
would fail. -/
def Tableau.U1 {H : History} {X : Sequent} (tab : Tableau H X) : Prop :=
  ∀ f : FinePathIn tab, ¬ f.base.isLrep →

    ∧ (f.label.2.2.isLeft → ¬ f.label.rightFree.basic → f.usesRightRule)

/-- Condition U2: two nodes whose loaded component is the same and not basic, and whose
unloaded components are both basic, apply the same rule to the same formula of the loaded
component. As the loaded component is not basic the rule must be a local one, so we may
state this for the local rule applications `f.lra?` and `g.lra?`. -/
def Tableau.U2 {H : History} {X : Sequent} (tab : Tableau H X) : Prop :=
  ∀ (f g : FinePathIn tab) (lraf lrag : LocalRuleApp),

          lraf.isLeftRule → lrag.isLeftRule → lraf.SameRuleAs lrag) )

  tab.U1 ∧ tab.U2

/-- A tableau is *uniform* if it satisfies the conditions U1 and U2.

We also demand U1 and U2 for the flipped tableau `tab.flip`, in which the left and the
right components of all sequents are swapped. This is not an extra demand: U1 and U2 are
symmetric in the two components, so `tab.UniCore` and `tab.flip.UniCore` say the same
thing. Asking for both here only spares us the purely technical work of transporting U1
and U2 along `Tableau.flip`, which would need a `flip` operation on `FinePathIn`.
What it buys us is `Tableau.isUniform.flip` below, which is needed because the
interpolation proof flips the tableau when the loaded formula is on the left. -/

/-! ## Uniform tableaux by construction

To obtain uniform tableaux we follow approach (B): instead of repairing a given tableau we
describe how a uniform one is built, by fixing *which* local rule is applied at each node.
The conditions U1 and U2 only speak about the local rules applied at the nodes, and both are
conditions that can be read off a single rule application together with the sequent it is
applied to. This is what `LocalRuleApp.IsUniChoice` below says:

* the rule is applied to the unloaded component, unless that component is basic (U1); and
* if it is applied to the loaded component (the unloaded one then being basic) then it is
  *the* canonical rule for that component, given by `uniRightChoice` resp. `uniLeftChoice`.

Since the canonical rule only depends on the loaded component `Λᵢ(s)`, any two nodes with
the same loaded component use the same rule, which is U2. A tableau all of whose rule
applications are `IsUniChoice` is called `Tableau.IsUni`, and `Tableau.IsUni.uniCore` shows
that such a tableau indeed satisfies U1 and U2. The construction is symmetric under flipping
(`Tableau.IsUni.flip`), which gives the second half of `Tableau.isUniform`. -/

/-- A tableau all of whose local rule applications are uniform choices is uniform. -/
theorem Tableau.IsUni.isUniform {X} {tab : Tableau .nil X} (h : tab.IsUni) : tab.isUniform :=
  ⟨h.uniCore, h.flip.uniCore⟩

/-! ## Building a uniform tableau

We now show `Tableau.exists_isUni`: for every tableau there is one that applies the rules in
the canonical order. The construction is deterministic: `uniChoiceAt` picks, at each sequent,
the canonical rule application (first a rule for the unloaded component, and once that is
basic the canonical rule for the loaded component), and `uniLocalTab` iterates this to a
local tableau all of whose rule applications are uniform choices (`uniLocalTab_isUni`).

Given an arbitrary tableau we then re-build it, replacing the local tableau at each `loc`
step by the canonical one. Because the end nodes of the canonical local tableau need not be
literally the same lists as the end nodes of the original one, we prove the statement in the
more flexible form `Tableau.exists_isUni_of_msEq`, allowing the sequent and the history to
change up to `Sequent.multisetEqTo`, i.e. up to permutation of the two lists in a sequent.
That the calculus does not care about such permutations is `PdlRule.exists_of_multisetEqTo`
and `lpr_of_multisetEqTo`.

The only step that is left open is `uniLocalTab_endNode_dominated`. -/

/-! ## Refutable sequents

To show that the local development of a sequent does not depend on the order in which the
rules are applied we have to deal with *clashes*: one local tableau may close a branch with
a closure rule while another one first decomposes the two clashing formulas. So we need to
know that a clash cannot get lost, i.e. that after applying any local rule to a closed
sequent the resulting sequents can still be closed.

We call a sequent `Refutable` if it has a local tableau without any end nodes. Note that we
only ask for the *existence* of such a local tableau; this is all that is needed below, and
it can be shown by purely syntactic means: the interesting case is when the rule applied is
the box or the diamond unfolding for the two clashing formulas `⌈α⌉ψ` and `~⌈α⌉ψ`. There
the branches of `unfoldBox` and of `unfoldDiamond` clash pairwise, either on a test or on a
formula `⌈⌈δ⌉⌉ψ`, which is `Dset_mem_P_of_tests` below. -/

/-! ### Clashes survive the application of a rule

The next lemmas say that a clash in a sequent cannot be lost by applying a local rule:
the results are again refutable. The interesting cases are those where the rule is applied
to one of the two clashing formulas. -/

/-- To show that `X` is refutable it suffices to apply a one-sided rule to a formula `p` of
`X` and to refute all the results. The resulting sequents are only described by two
properties, so that we do not have to care about which of the two components `p` is in:
all formulas of `X` other than `p` are still present, and the result of the rule was added. -/

/-! ### Uniform tableaux

**Warning.** The proof of `Tableau.exists_isUni` given for `List`-based sequents does not
survive the move to `Finset`-based sequents, and neither do the statements it was built
from. The reason is that with `Finset` components a formula that is re-created by a rule is
no longer counted twice, so the end nodes of a local tableau really do depend on the order
in which the rules are applied. Concretely, let `a`, `b`, `c` be atomic and consider the
sequent with left component `L = {~(a⋀b), (~(a⋀b))⋀c}` (empty right component, no loaded
formula).

* Applying `con` to `(~(a⋀b))⋀c` first gives the single child `{~(a⋀b), c}`, and applying
  `nCo` there gives the two end nodes `{~a, c}` and `{~b, c}`.
* Applying `nCo` to `~(a⋀b)` first gives the children `{(~(a⋀b))⋀c, ~a}` and
  `{(~(a⋀b))⋀c, ~b}`; unfolding the conjunction re-creates `~(a⋀b)`, which then has to be
  unfolded again, so `{~a, ~b, c}` is an end node of every local tableau below the first
  child.

So `{~a, ~b, c}` is an end node in the second order but not in the first one. (For `List`
components this cannot happen: in the first order the child is `[~(a⋀b), ~(a⋀b), c]`, with
two copies of the formula, and unfolding both of them also produces `[~a, ~b, c]`.)

Hence `Sequent.dominatedBy_child` and `uniLocalTab_endNode_dominated` above are *false* for
`Finset`-based sequents and are commented out. The statement `Tableau.exists_isUni` itself
is still plausible — the extra formulas of an end node of the canonical local tableau make
it *easier* to refute — but proving it now needs a weakening argument for tableaux instead
of the commutation argument, which is left open here. -/

satisfies `Tableau.IsUni`.
