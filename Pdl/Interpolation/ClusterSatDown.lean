/-! # Satisfiability down the quasi-tableau, and the right half of the correctness of `θ_r`

This file continues the development of `Pdl.ClusterRho` with

* Lemma 10.6: between a companion and its repeat there is a basic node,
* Lemma 10.7: if `Δ_x, ι_x` is satisfiable then so is `Δ_z, ι_z` for some `z ∈ cycs(x)`,
* Lemma 10.8: `Γ₂ ⊨ ¬θ_r`.

Definition 10.4 (the distance `d_α`) and Lemma 10.5 (its properties) are in `Pdl.Distance`,
where they are numbered 7.47. The auxiliary notions used below — the evaluation `evalQ` of
Q-formulas with an assignment, the witness distance `witDist`, and `BasicBetween` — are in
`Pdl.EvalQ`.

/-! ## Lemma 10.6

If `x` is a repeat in `Q` then the path from `c(x)` to `x` passes through a node with a
basic label.

The proof in the paper claims that nodes of type 1 can only succeed nodes of type 3 with a
basic label; that is not the case, see Definition 9.8. What is true, and what we use here,
is that the label of a node of type 3 with a *non-basic* label strictly decreases when
passing to the children: the rule applied there is a local rule. Hence if no basic node
occurred between `c(x)` and `x` then `Δ_x` would be strictly smaller than `Δ_{c(x)}`,
contradicting `Δ_x = Δ_{c(x)}`. -/

/-- **Lemma 10.6**: if `z` is a repeat in `Q` with companion `c(z)`, then the path from
`c(z)` to `z` passes through a node of type 3 whose label is basic.

The proof in the paper argues that a repeat is of type 1, and that in `Q` a node of type 1
can only succeed a node of type 3 with a basic label. In the construction of `Q`
(Definition 9.8) the children of a node of type 3 are of type 1 also when the label is
*not* basic, so that argument does not apply directly. We use instead that the labels of
the successors of a non-basic node are smaller in some measure `m`, so a repeat — which
has the *same* label as its companion — cannot be reached from its companion by non-basic
steps only. -/

/-! ## Assumptions about the steps of the quasi-tableau

Just like `LoadedCluster.PaperFacts` for Lemma 10.3, the proof of Lemma 10.7 uses facts
about the tableau `tab` and the sequents `Λ₂[C]` that are not (yet) available in this Lean
development. They are collected here in one record. -/

/-- Facts about the cluster `C` used in the proof of Lemma 10.7.

* `rightLoaded` says that all `Δ ∈ Λ₂[C]` carry their loaded formula on the right; this is
  the standing assumption of Section 9 that `Γ₂` is the loaded side.
* `stepLT` provides a decreasing measure needed for Lemma 10.6 (`repeat_basicBetween`).
  A local rule applied to an unloaded formula, or the rule `(◇)₂` applied to the loaded
  formula, strictly decreases the DM ordering on sequents.
* `basicStep` describes the modal step at a basic `Δ ∈ Λ₂[C]`: there is exactly one
  successor sequent `Y`, obtained by projecting along the leading atomic program `a` of
  the loaded formula and dropping `a` from it.
* `nonBasicStep` describes the local step at a non-basic `Δ ∈ Λ₂[C]`: whenever `Δ` holds at
  a state, one of the successor sequents holds at the same state, with the same witness
  distance. In the paper this is proved by a case distinction on whether the rule was
  applied to an unloaded formula (local invertibility) or to the loaded formula (in which
  case it is Lemma 10.5(h), `existsD_of_true_diamond`). -/

/-- The Claim in the proof of Lemma 10.7, for the node `x` of the quasi-tableau: whenever
`Δ_x, ι_x` is satisfied at a state `v`, there is a repeat leaf `z ∈ cycs(x)` and a state
`u` satisfying `Δ_z, ι_z` with a witness distance that is not larger, and that is strictly
smaller if there is a basic node between `x` and `z`.

The internal variables of the pre-interpolants are interpreted by an assignment `g`; see
the module docstring. -/

/-- **Lemma 10.8**: `Γ₂ ⊨ ¬θ_r`, i.e. the right component of the root of the cluster
together with the interpolant of Definition 9.20 is unsatisfiable.

The hypothesis `Γ₁ ≠ ∅` is the one of Definition 9.20: for `Γ₁ = ∅` we have `θ_r = ⊤` by
Remark 9.19, and then the statement would say that `Γ₂` itself is unsatisfiable. -/
