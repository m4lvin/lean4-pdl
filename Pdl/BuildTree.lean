/-! ## Pre-states (Def 6.13)

As possible worlds for the model graph we want to define *maximal* paths inside the build tree
that do not contain `(M)` steps.

In the paper pre-states are allowed to be of the form π;π' when π ends at a repeat and π' is a
maximal prefix of the path from the companion to that repeat. Here we only store the π part of
such pre-states, because the π' is then uniquely determined by π. -/
